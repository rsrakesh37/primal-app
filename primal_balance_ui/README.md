Primal Balance - Flutter UI scaffold
===================================

What you get:
- A runnable Flutter project scaffold (UI only) with screens:
  - Splash, Onboarding, Login, Home, Booking, Video Library, Account
- Dark masculine theme (black + gold accent based on your logo)
- Responsive layout for phones and tablets (simple breakpoints)
- Assets: includes your uploaded logo (assets/images/logo.png)

How to run:
1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev
2. From the project root run:
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

Notes & next steps:
- This scaffold focuses on UI and navigation only â€” it does NOT include backend integrations (Momence/Stripe).
- Replace placeholder program/video items with your real data and images (use men-only imagery as required).
- To integrate Trae.ai design pack, provide guidance or I can export design tokens separately.

Files included in the ZIP:
- lib/: Dart source files for screens and widgets
- assets/images/logo.png
- pubspec.yaml
- README.md

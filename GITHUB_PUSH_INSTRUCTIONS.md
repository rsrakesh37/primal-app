# üöÄ Push to GitHub for Mobile Builds

## üì± Goal: Get Real APK and IPA Files

You need to create a GitHub repository and push your code to trigger automatic mobile app builds.

## üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `primal-balance` (or any name you prefer)
4. Description: `Complete financial management app with Flutter and PHP`
5. Set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Actions)
6. **DON'T** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the repository URL that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/primal-balance.git
```

### Step 3: Run These Commands
Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/primal-balance.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
